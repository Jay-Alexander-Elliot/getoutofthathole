## Safely Transporting a Gaming Rig

### General Tips
1. Protect both the outside and inside of the computer.
2. Use original packing materials if available.
3. Consider additional protection based on the transportation method (driving, flying, shipping).

### Internal Component Safety
- **CPU Cooler**:
  - Remove if it's tall or uses plastic push pins.
  - Use an AIO water cooling kit for safer transportation.
  - Pack extra material around the cooler to prevent movement.

- **Hard Drives**:
  - Remove and carry separately or back up data.
  - Ensure drives are securely mounted to minimize shock and vibration damage.

- **Edge Connectors (RAM, Network Cards, GPUs)**:
  - Secure RAM with zip ties.
  - Remove heavy components like GPUs and place them in anti-static bags.
  - Tie down loose cables to prevent internal damage.

### Packing the Case
- **Foam and Bubble Wrap**:
  - Use expanding foam packs or anti-static foam to fill empty spaces.
  - Utilize household materials like pool noodles for added protection.

- **Boxing**:
  - Use the original case box inside another larger box.
  - Ensure the packing foam hasn't lost its structural integrity.
  - Avoid shipping the monitor in the same box as the PC.

### Final Touches
- **External Protection**:
  - Use sufficient packing material to prevent movement inside the outer box.
  - Securely tape the box and consider labeling it as "fragile," though special handling is not guaranteed.

### Additional Recommendations
- Use protective measures like anti-static bags and extra padding for all components.

### Closing Tips
- Proper packing and securing of internal components are crucial.
- Double-boxing and using original packaging can enhance safety.
- Label the box appropriately but manage expectations regarding handling care.
