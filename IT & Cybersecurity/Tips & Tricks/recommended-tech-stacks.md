### Summary

In the past two years, I've consistently stuck with the same tech stack, allowing me to ship 21 products, attract 260,000 page views per month, and generate over $50,000 in revenue, all while working solo. My tech stack costs only $67 per month, and I manage customer support with minimal issues.

**Frontend:**
- **ReactJS:** Uses only basic features like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- **Next.js:** Great for page routing and SEO.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Easier for styling by embedding styles in HTML.
- **Daisy UI:** Provides ready-to-use UI components.

**Backend:**
- **Next.js Serverless Functions:** Easy API endpoint creation without OS maintenance.
- **MongoDB:** Simple and fast setup, uses M0 clusters for free, and occasional backups cost $10/month.
- **Mongoose:** Simplifies MongoDB queries.
- **Mailgun:** Free for initial use, $3-4/month for sending 3-4,000 emails.
- **Stripe:** Handles payments with a comprehensive API.

**Hosting:**
- **Vercel:** Deploys changes from GitHub, costs $20/month for 21 projects, and supports 50,000 monthly visitors.

**Monitoring:**
- **Plausible:** Tracks site visitors and events for $29/month.
- **Vercel Logs:** Free 24-hour log access for bug tracking.
- **Manual Split Testing:** Uses MongoDB for tracking.

**Additional Tools:**
- **AI Models (GPT-4):** For specific product features, costing $20/month in OpenAI credits.
- **AWS Services:** S3 for image hosting and CloudFront as a CDN.
- **GitHub Copilot:** Assists in coding for $10/month.

**Conclusion:**
Sticking to one tech stack helps improve efficiency and speed in shipping products. Focus on delivering value to customers rather than chasing the latest trends.
