With a DevOps background and aiming to enhance your employability in a poor economy, acquiring additional certifications that complement the Jamf Pro Associate certification can make you more versatile and valuable to potential employers. Here are a few certifications that align well with your goals, especially within IT, system administration, and DevOps realms:

1. **Apple Certified Support Professional (ACSP)** - Focuses on support and troubleshooting macOS systems. This certification complements Jamf Pro Associate well, given Jamf Pro's emphasis on managing Apple devices.

2. **AWS Certified Solutions Architect or AWS Certified DevOps Engineer** - With cloud services becoming integral to IT infrastructure, AWS certifications can significantly bolster your credentials, especially in environments that deploy Apple devices extensively and use AWS for cloud services.

3. **Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate** - Similar to AWS certifications, Azure certifications are invaluable for professionals working in environments that use Microsoft's cloud services, offering a broad understanding of cloud services, including how they're provided with Microsoft Azure.

4. **CompTIA Security+** - Given the increasing focus on cybersecurity, Security+ certifies baseline cybersecurity skills. It's broadly recognized and would complement your role in managing and securing Apple devices in enterprise environments.

5. **Docker Certified Associate (DCA)** - With containerization being a key component of DevOps, the DCA certification demonstrates your proficiency with Docker technologies, complementing your DevOps background and enhancing your versatility in CI/CD pipelines.

6. **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** - Kubernetes is leading the container orchestration domain, and having a CKA demonstrates your abilities in this critical area, which is essential for modern DevOps practices.

7. **Linux Professional Institute Certification (LPIC-1)** - Since much of DevOps and system administration involves Linux, LPIC-1 can prove your competency in basic maintenance tasks via the command line, installing and configuring Linux computers, and configuring basic networking.

8. **Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)** - For those looking to dive deeper into security, CISSP is a highly respected certification that covers critical security topics, beneficial for securing applications and devices managed through Jamf Pro.

Choosing certifications should align with your career goals, the industries you aim to work in, and the technologies those industries rely on. While certifications can significantly enhance your resume, gaining hands-on experience through projects, internships, or relevant job roles is equally important to demonstrate your skills and knowledge effectively.
