<p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Jay-Alexander Elliot, a software engineering student just starting out at Utah Valley University. I'm interested in building tech products and helping others learn. At UVU, I'm actively developing my skills in Python, Golang, and C++, while also working with technologies like React, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Git, and various LLM tools such as Ollama and Groq.</p>

<h2>My Interests</h2>
<p>Beyond my academic journey, I enjoy exploring history, mythology, and religion. I'm also deeply interested in brain-computer interfaces, fitness, and continuous personal growth.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Future Projects I'd love to work on</h2> 
<ul>
    <li><b>Garden Bot:</b> A <b>*mostly*</b> autonomous gardening robot that can be taught to tend to a garden, using sensors, machine learning, and Large Language Models to monitor plant health and automate maintenance.</li>
    <li><b>Brain-Computer Interface API</b> I'm interested in developing an API for BCI devices that can be used to control software applications and devices with brain signals.</li>
    <li><b>Video Game:</b> I'm writing a story about a combat exorcist in a setting that's thematically similar to "Kentaro Mirura's Berserk", but with much greater emphasis on knowing the weaknesses and "names" of your foe as opposed to brute force violence.</li>
</ul>


<p>Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects I'm working on, my key skills, and the journey I'm starting at UVU. I'm excited to share my work with you!</p>
