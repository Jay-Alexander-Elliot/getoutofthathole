# Robotics Simulation Resources
## Adapted from a direct message to me on the **LeRobot** discord.


Welcome to our simulation resources! We utilize Mujoco and Pygame for creating and running simulations, tailored for robotics applications.

## Simulation Libraries
- **Mujoco**: Known for its accuracy and speed in physics simulation. Python bindings are used for integration.
  - Check out our [gym-xarm Mujoco simulation](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-xarm).
  - For a basic tutorial on Mujoco, visit this [Google Colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/python/tutorial.ipynb).

- **Pygame**: Used for more straightforward, 2D simulations.
  - Explore our [gym-pusht Pygame example](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-pusht/).

## Common Interface
- **Gymnasium**: We standardize our simulations with Gymnasium to provide a common interface across all environments.
  - Learn about basic usage [here](https://gymnasium.farama.org/content/basic_usage/).
  - Find a tutorial on creating your own environment [here](https://gymnasium.farama.org/tutorials/gymnasium_basics/environment_creation/).

These resources are designed to get you started with robotics simulations, providing both complex physics-based and simpler 2D scenarios.
