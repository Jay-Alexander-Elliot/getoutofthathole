# to do

## I need to create a "jungian style spirituality", action plan.

### I need to compile a list of groups near me for the following:

- breathwork practioner meetups, events, and workshops. (grof)
- Meditation centers; Emphasis on Tibetian, Bon Buddhist meditation schools.
- Kundalini yoga studios; Choose a school that's run by an instructor whose had an "awakening."
- I need to find people or shamans associated with native american tribes who can help facilitate spiritual growth. stuff along the lines of sweat lodges, sun dances, and vision quests.
- I need to find groups like the native american church (peyote), the divine assembly (psilocybin), etc. That can help faciliate safe vision quests in a controlled environment.
- I need to find or create a group that can help facilitate the study of consciousness with BCIs.

### I need to create a fine tune corpus on the world's religious and mystical texts:

- I need to utilize written text, erowid, and youtube transcripts.
- This corpus would be used to train/fine tune an LLM, this would also be hooked up to a RAG.
- The model would need to utilize a high quality, uncensored model. something based on llama 3 or command r.
- use [peft](https://github.com/huggingface/peft), it's far more efficient than traditional fine-tuning.
- The prompting for this AI needs to take the approach of a "caring mystical mentor."
- I need to seek out an erowid dataset. reach out to Dr. Emil O. W. Kirkegaard, he did a sentiment analysis on mystical experience testimonies. he might still have the dataset. his [website](https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/)
- create a network graph to display commonalities between experiences. example: i want all instances of mantis entities to be tagged with the other motifs and themes they're appearing with.
    - FOSS Options for Network Graph Tools
    1. **Gephi**: An open-source software for network visualization and analysis, which allows you to explore, analyze, spatialize, filter, clump, manipulate, and export all types of networks. Gephi uses a 3D render engine to display graphs in real-time and speed up the exploration. [Gephi Website](https://gephi.org/)
    2. **Graphviz**: This is an open-source graph visualization software that provides a convenient scripting language, DOT, for describing graphs. It's very powerful for generating structured diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. [Graphviz Website](http://www.graphviz.org/)
    3. **NetworkX**: A Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. It is especially useful in mathematical, scientific, and engineering contexts. [NetworkX GitHub](https://networkx.github.io/)
- I should reach out to that UVU professor who does data visualization and bioinformatics.
- I aught to register here: [research publishing website](https://orcid.org/)
- follow this guy's stuff, and make accounts on the stuff he's on. [website](https://mvuorre.github.io/)
- [chemical youth](https://chemicalyouth.org/visualising-erowid/), is an interesting website that's datamined and analyzed erowid.
