## UVU Food Resources for Students

### 1. UVU Food Pantry

The UVU Food Pantry is an essential resource available to UVU students, faculty, and staff experiencing food insecurity. It provides canned and boxed food items, basic hygiene products, and occasionally baby products depending on stock availability from their partner, Community Action Services and Food Bank. Services are accessible from Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., at the Center for Social Impact, SL 101, located under the SLWC bridge.

- **Eligibility**: Students need to be enrolled in at least 6 credits during the Fall/Spring semesters; however, enrollment is not required during the Summer terms. The pantry can be accessed once per week per student.
- **Accessing the Pantry**: Students can fill an online order form or visit in person. A UVU ID is required for pantry use.
- **Donations**: While the pantry itself does not accept direct food donations, interested parties can donate to the Community Action Services and Food Bank.

### 2. UVU Community Garden (GRIT Garden)

The GRIT Garden is another vital initiative by UVU, providing fresh produce that supports the Food Pantry. This community garden is located east of the Utah County Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and includes a variety of seasonal vegetables. It serves as a space for community education and social engagement while promoting sustainability.

### 3. Fresh Food Fridays

This program is a collaboration between the UVU GRIT Garden and Community Action Services, offering fresh produce to students every Friday. Participation requires a UVU ID and a reusable bag.

### 4. Mobile Food Pantry

The Mobile Pantry extends the reach of UVU's food assistance programs to satellite campuses including West, Wasatch, Provo Airport, Thanksgiving Point, and the Wee Care Center, providing both perishable and non-perishable items.

### 5. Additional Programs and Supports

- **Food Recovery Initiatives**: Partnerships with local grocery stores and businesses to reduce food waste and increase food availability.
- **Educational and Cooking Programs**: The pantry organizes cooking classes using produce from the GRIT Garden to educate students on preparing healthy meals.

### 6. Community Collaborations

UVU's food programs actively collaborate with local organizations to enhance the support network available to students. This includes partnerships with United Way for logistical support and Community Action Services for food supply.
