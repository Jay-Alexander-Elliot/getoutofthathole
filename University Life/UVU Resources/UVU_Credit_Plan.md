# Action Plan for Accelerating College Credit Accumulation

## Background
- Current accepted credits: 71
- Total initial credits: 85 (14 credits not transferred, planning to petition)
- Objective: Maximize credit accumulation across spring, summer, fall, and winter sessions, utilizing all available strategies to ensure maximum credit transfer and placement.

## Strategy
1. **Credit Petitioning**: Immediately initiate the petition process for the 14 non-transferred credits, providing comprehensive documentation and justifications.

2. **Placement Tests**: Schedule and prepare for placement tests to qualify for higher-level classes, optimizing credit earning potential.

3. **Credit Load Planning**:
    - **Assessment**: Consider work hours and desired graduation timeline to determine optimal credit load.
    - **Formula for Credit Load**:
        - 3 credit hours = 3 class hours/week = 6-9 study hours/week.
        - Full-time: 12-18 credit hours/semester.
        - Part-time: 1-11 credit hours/semester.
    - **Work Hours Consideration**:
        - 40 hrs/week work = 3-5 credits.
        - 30 hrs/week work = 3-9 credits.
        - 20 hrs/week work = 6-12 credits.
        - <20 hrs/week work = 12-18 credits.

4. **Annual Credit Goals**:
    - Bachelor's degree = ~120 credits.
    - Divide total credits by desired years in college for annual credit goal.
    - Example: 120 credits / 4 years = 30 credits/year.

5. **Time Management**:
    - Allocate hours for work, study, classes, sleep, and leisure based on 168-hour weekly total.
    - Prioritize obligations to maintain performance and well-being.

6. **Additional Strategies**:
    - Explore accelerated courses, online classes, and summer/winter sessions to add flexibility and increase credit intake.
    - Regularly consult academic advisors to align course selection with degree requirements and transfer policies.

## Execution
- Draft a semester-by-semester plan, incorporating placement tests, petition outcomes, and workload.
- Continuously reevaluate and adjust the plan based on progress and any new opportunities (e.g., CLEP tests, AP credits).

## Note
- Remember the importance of balance to prevent burnout. Prioritize health and well-being alongside academic and work commitments.
