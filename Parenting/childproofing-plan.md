# Comprehensive Childproofing Plan

## Introduction
This guide aims to help parents implement a defense-in-depth strategy to protect children from exposure to harmful online content such as pornography and inappropriate social media interactions. The strategy includes measures at the device, browser, and network levels, and utilizes various technologies and tools to ensure comprehensive protection.

## Device-Level Protections

### 1. Setting Up User Accounts
- **Create Separate Accounts**: Set up individual user accounts for children on each device (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS). Ensure these accounts have restricted permissions.
- **Parental Control Software**: Install parental control software to manage and monitor device usage.
    - Examples of software include: **Norton Family, Qustodio, Net Nanny**

### 2. Operating System Settings
- **Windows**: Use Microsoft Family Safety to set screen time limits, filter content, and monitor activity.
- **macOS**: Use Screen Time to manage app usage, set content restrictions, and monitor activity.
- **iOS**: Utilize Screen Time to set app limits, content restrictions, and monitor usage.
- **Android**: Use Family Link to manage screen time, app usage, and set content restrictions.

### 3. Application Restrictions
- **App Store Restrictions**: Enable restrictions on app stores to prevent downloading inappropriate apps.
- **Approved Apps Only**: Set devices to only allow installation of apps from a pre-approved list.

## Browser-Level Protections

### 1. Safe Browsers
- **Kid-Safe Browsers**: Install kid-safe browsers like KidzSearch or Kiddle that automatically filter out inappropriate content.
- **Browser Extensions**: Use extensions like uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus, or Privacy Badger to block ads and trackers.

### 2. Search Engine Settings
- **SafeSearch**: Enable SafeSearch on Google and Bing to filter out explicit content.
- **Custom Search Engines**: Use custom search engines designed for kids, such as Kiddle.co.

## Network-Level Protections

### 1. DNS Filtering
- **DNS Filtering Services**: Use DNS filtering services like OpenDNS FamilyShield or CleanBrowsing to block access to harmful websites at the network level.
- **Router Configuration**: Change the DNS settings on your router to a family-friendly DNS service.

### 2. Router Settings
- **Advanced Router**: Invest in a router that supports advanced parental controls and content filtering, such as a Netgear Nighthawk or ASUS RT-series routers.
- **Router Parental Controls**: Access your router’s admin panel to set up website filtering, time limits, and device-specific rules.

### 3. Network Monitoring
- **Network Monitoring Tools**: Use tools like Circle with Disney, Gryphon, or Fingbox to manage and monitor internet usage across all connected devices.
- **Activity Logs**: Regularly review activity logs to ensure no inappropriate content is accessed.

## Additional Measures

### 1. Mobile Device Management (MDM)
- **MDM Solutions**: Consider using Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions for more granular control over mobile devices, especially in managing app installations and usage. MDM solutions provide a centralized way to manage and secure mobile devices, making them an excellent choice for parents who want to ensure their children use their devices safely and appropriately. Here are some key benefits and steps for implementing MDM solutions:

#### Benefits of MDM Solutions

1. **Centralized Management**: MDM solutions allow you to manage multiple devices from a single dashboard. This makes it easier to apply consistent policies and settings across all your children’s devices.

2. **App Management**: With MDM, you can control which apps can be installed on the devices. You can whitelist approved apps, block inappropriate apps, and even push educational apps remotely.

3. **Content Filtering**: Many MDM solutions include content filtering features that help block access to inappropriate websites and content, providing an additional layer of protection beyond browser and network-level controls.

4. **Usage Monitoring**: MDM solutions provide detailed reports on device usage, including which apps are used and for how long. This helps parents monitor their children's activities and identify any potential issues early on.

5. **Remote Configuration and Updates**: You can remotely configure device settings and push updates to ensure that all devices are running the latest software versions and security patches.

6. **Geolocation and Geofencing**: Some MDM solutions offer geolocation and geofencing features, allowing you to track the device's location and set up alerts if the device leaves a designated area.

#### Steps for Implementing MDM Solutions

1. **Choose an MDM Solution**: Research and select an MDM solution that meets your needs. Some popular options include:
   - **Google Family Link**: A free option for managing Android devices with basic MDM features.
   - **Apple Screen Time**: Built-in MDM features for iOS and macOS devices.
   - **Qustodio**: A comprehensive parental control and MDM solution compatible with multiple platforms.
   - **Cisco Meraki**: An enterprise-level MDM solution with robust features, suitable for tech-savvy parents.

2. **Set Up MDM Accounts**: Create accounts on the chosen MDM platform and set up profiles for each of your children’s devices.

3. **Configure Policies and Restrictions**: Define and apply policies that restrict app installations, set usage limits, and filter content. Customize these settings based on the age and maturity level of each child.

4. **Enroll Devices**: Enroll each device in the MDM system. This typically involves installing an MDM app or profile on the device and linking it to your MDM account.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review usage reports and adjust settings as needed. Ensure that the policies remain effective and appropriate as your children grow and their needs change.

6. **Educate Your Children**: Explain the purpose of the MDM solution to your children and how it helps keep them safe. Encourage open communication about any issues or concerns they may have.

### 2. Education and Communication
- **Open Dialogue**: Maintain an open dialogue with your children about online safety and the reasons behind these protections.
- **Educational Resources**: Provide educational resources and training on safe internet practices.

### 3. Supervised Usage
- **Common Areas**: Place computers and devices in common areas where you can easily monitor their use.

### 4. Regular Reviews and Updates
- **Regular Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews of the security measures in place and update them as necessary to adapt to new threats.
- **Software Updates**: Ensure all devices and software are up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.

### 5. Content Agreements
- **Family Internet Usage Agreement**: Establish a family internet usage agreement that outlines acceptable online behavior and the consequences of breaking the rules.
