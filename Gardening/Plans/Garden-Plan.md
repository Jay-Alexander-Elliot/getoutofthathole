### Various plants I'm interested in growing for personal consumption.

## Grow zone legend for reference.

Zone 4b: This zone is characterized by minimum temperatures of -25 to -20 degrees Fahrenheit. It is found in the highest elevations of the Uinta Mountains, making it suitable for very cold-hardy plants.

Zone 5a: Minimum temperatures in this zone range from -20 to -15 degrees Fahrenheit. It occurs in several elevated areas, including parts of the Wasatch Range.

Zone 5b: This zone experiences minimum temperatures between -15 to -10 degrees Fahrenheit. It is common in the higher valleys and plateau areas of the state.

Zone 6a: Characterized by minimum temperatures of -10 to -5 degrees Fahrenheit, this zone includes many of the valley regions that are somewhat protected from the coldest winter extremes.

Zone 6b: With minimum temperatures ranging from -5 to 0 degrees Fahrenheit, this zone covers a significant portion of central Utah, providing a moderate climate for a diverse range of plants.

Zone 7a: This zone is characterized by minimum temperatures of 0 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit. It is found primarily in the lower valley areas that are sheltered from the coldest winter temperatures.

Zone 7b: Minimum temperatures in this zone range from 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. This includes areas around the major urban centers like Salt Lake City, which are shielded by the surrounding mountains.

Zone 8a: Characterized by minimum temperatures of 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit, this zone is found in a few very sheltered areas in the southernmost parts of the state, allowing for a variety of both temperate and some subtropical plants.
