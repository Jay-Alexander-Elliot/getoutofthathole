# Propagating Lavender from Cuttings

## Overview
- Propagation is best done in spring or fall when the wood is semi-hard.
- Lavender can be propagated year-round in a greenhouse.
- Hardwood cuttings have greater disease and pest resistance than those propagated from seeds.

## Propagation Methods
### Direct Ground Planting
- **Cutting Preparation**: 
  - Take a cutting from semi-hardwood.
  - Remove lower leaves and ensure the cutting has a green base.
- **Planting**:
  - Insert the cutting directly into well-draining soil.
  - Water weekly or less if it's raining.
- **Advantages**: 
  - Greater size growth due to access to soil nutrients.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires weeding and cannot be moved until fall.

### Pot Planting
- **Cutting Preparation**: 
  - Same as above but trim to fit the starter tray.
  - Optionally use rooting hormone, though not strictly necessary.
- **Planting**:
  - Fill trays with a mixture of peat moss and perlite or sand.
  - Insert the cutting, water, and maintain consistent humidity.
- **Advantages**: 
  - Cuttings can be transplanted to larger pots later.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Pots require frequent watering as soil dries quickly.

## Growth and Care Tips
- Monitor cuttings for root development in 4-6 weeks.
- Be patient; some cuttings may root slower than others.
- Use weed mat for ground plantings to minimize weeds and retain soil moisture.
- Maintain soil mix humidity for pot plantings but avoid waterlogging.

## Final Recommendations
- Prune lavender in spring and fall.
- Avoid using seeds if uniformity is desired.
- Take time to care for the plants but don't stressâ€”gardening should be enjoyable.
