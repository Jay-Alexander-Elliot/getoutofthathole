## 3. Atmospheric Water Generators (AWG)
- **Description**: Machines that extract moisture from the air, working like a dehumidifier but designed for water production.
- **Cost**: Prices range from $1,500 for smaller units to $30,000 for larger, more capable units.
- **Pros**:
  - Can produce water in a variety of humidity conditions.
  - Provides a consistent water supply.
- **Cons**:
  - High energy consumption, especially in drier conditions.
  - Larger units are expensive.

## 4. Solar-Powered Atmospheric Water Generators
- **Description**: Similar to regular AWGs but utilizes solar power, reducing electricity use.
- **Cost**: Generally more expensive than non-solar units, estimated at $2,000 to $60,000.
- **Pros**:
  - Energy-efficient, using renewable solar energy.
  - Suitable for remote or off-grid locations.
- **Cons**:
  - Higher initial cost than conventional AWGs.
  - Performance heavily dependent on both sunlight and humidity levels.
